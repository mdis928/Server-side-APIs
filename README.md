# Server-side-APIs

For this homework, the goal was to focus on the functionality on the server side web API calls. In this case, we are making a call to the OpenWeather API. In order for this to work, we need to get an API key.

Once we have our API key, we can use ajax or fetch to make a call to the API. We can then use variables with values. We can then use that data and then populate it in the correct places on the webpage. 

The relevant data needed to be populates on the city div that is being presented and also the five day forecast




GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs

WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history ✅ 


WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index ✅ 


WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe


WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity ✅ 


WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city ✅
